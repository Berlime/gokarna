When I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).

You say why I blog? Well before this, I didn’t mange to get a hold of a computer. So what I did is, write a journal but wouldn’t call it a journal.

You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting. There are 3 versions of this which will remain offline for keepsake and nostalgic moments.

It has been about 4 years since I last blog.

Now thanks to [mdtasnim](https://mdtasnim.com) who introduced me back to blogging, this time hosting on my own server, own sub-domain.

I hereby announce, the launch of Alter Ego 2. My 5th journal/blogging iteration. Here are just a brief breakdown of the editions.
