Back in 2009 when I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).

You say why I blog? Well before this, I didn’t mange to get a hold of a computer. So what I did is, write a journal. I wouldn’t call it a journal.

You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting. There are 3 versions of this which will remain offline for keepsake and nostalgic moments.

It has been about 4 years since I last blog and today.

Now thanks to mdtasnim who introduced me back to blogging, this time hosting on my own server, own sub-domain.

I hereby announce, the launch of Alter Ego 2. My 6th journal/blogging iteration. Here are just a brief breakdown of the editions.

1st Edition.
Title: What’s Up?
Theme: Magazine style physical journal.

2nd Edition.
Title: Alter Ego
Theme: Magazine style physical journal.

3rd Edition.
Title: Alter Ego Edited
Theme: Online version using blogpost.

4th Edition.
Title: Berlime5
Theme: A continuation of Alter Ego Edited

5th Version/
Title: Alter Ego 2

So this is my first post ever in this blog. If you see posts before this date, those are a #backtracked posts which means, I will post from the beginning of 2024 which I already drafted while developing this new blog. Cheers!
