When I was 16, I launched my blog site with blogpost.com (now blogger.com).

You say why I blog? Well, my parents did not manage to get a hold of a computer yet during that period. So what I did was, wrote a journal but wouldn’t call it a journal.

You see, the way I did it was to write in a ‘magazine’ look and format where there will be so called “ads” for the stuff I find interesting. There are 3 versions of this which will remain offline for keepsake and nostalgic moments.

It has been about 4 years since I last blog.

Now thanks to [mdtasnim](https://mdtasnim.com) who introduced me back to blogging, this time hosting on my own server & own sub-domain. You can find out more in 'Tags > #Static'. Under this tag, I wwill be sharing my journey in creating static website.
I will also be sharing what is static website for non-techies. You will be suprised that it is not what you thought. Stay tuned!

I hereby announce, the launch of Alter Ego 2. My 5th journal/blogging iteration. Here are the brief breakdown of the editions.

So this is my first post ever in this blog. If you see posts before this date, those are a #backtracked posts which means, I will post from the beginning of 2024 which I already drafted while developing this new blog. Cheers!

The special part of this iteration is, I will be keep editing existing blogposts to provide more context as times goes by, for example I may be editing a year old blog post just for the sake of keeps and sharing to the internet.
Another good example is, whenever there is an extention story from that particular event that I posted, I will provide a link for the continuation from that blog poost or event. Hope this makes sense.

Simply put, you will not see this website have regular post updates because of the reasons above.

If you are interested in following my journey in hopes giving inspiration, motivation. I welcome everyone in my life or used to be in my life to join me. 
No grudges, no nothing, haters are welcome too. :3
