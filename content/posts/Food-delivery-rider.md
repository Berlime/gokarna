## Let's Compare Between Working Fulltime & Being a Food Delivery Rider, Also Full Time.

If Panda for 21 days, which is the same as working fulltime at about 7 to 8 hours per day with around 1 hour break & small breaks in between.

Per day average $100 * 21 days = $2100

### Operation cost: - 

    Meals: Around $6 per day (Eat in JB, 1 drink in SG). 6*21=126 
    Petrol: $6 per day. 6*21=126 
    Total operation cost: 126+126=336   
    Take home cash: 2100-336=1764 

So, if work fulltime with 2100 after deduction (2625). For at least 8 hours.

### Average working days per month 21:-

    Operation cost:-
    Meals: $16 per day. 16*21=336 
    Petrol: $2 per day. 2*21=42
    Total operation cost: 336+42=378 
    Take home cash: 2100-378=1722 

Now we know the comparison if we work panda on working days on every month. The difference is not significant. While doing food delivery, the major cons is:

    - Requires physical energy.
    - Nuances of the weather.
    - Risky as most of the time is on the road.
    - Requires more petrol.

While working full time in an office have only financial downside which is needing to spend money on meals.

In conclusion, despite the little difference, working full time is still worth it.

But now let's count our commitment to see how if $2100 take home pay is actually enough in the first place.

Here is a simple list of the bills we need to consider:

    - Mortgage: $670
    - Maintenance Horizon Hills: $57
    - Vehicles: $461
    - Vehicle maintenance: $30
    - Petrol: $125
    - Utility Bills: $150
    - Phone: $70
    - Groceries: $100
    - Meals: $100
    - Insurance: $375
    - Family: $50
    - Shopping: $100

Well that's a lot, but I believe these are the essentials. So let's calculate.

    670+57+461+30+125+150+70+100+100+375+50+100=2,288 

So, the minimum take home pay should be $2288, which is $2860 monthly salary.

Let's look back at the panda we calculate earlier, for 21 days a month with $100 is not enough to cover the lists above. If we would want to work as a food delivery, a minimum of $110 per day. 5 days a week.

Which is $550.

So my current set up is 2 weekdays which is targeted at $200. And 2 weekends targeted at $400.

That is a total of $600 per week, which is enough for what we have aimed for.

However, in my current situation, I tend to skip some days and hours hence not getting a good financial health.

The main purpose on why I still cosider working fulltime even though that everyone knows that doing food delivery can get us more in terms of financial. But considering the risks that we have discussed before. Doing food delivery is not sustainable in the long term.

With that, my conclusion is if I were to work full time. The bare minimum is a $2860 monthly salary.
See, humans do not live on bare minimum or at least for me.

I want some financial breathing space and especially we as humans tend to try something new, travel new places which is require a comfortable amount of income. Hence with this conclusion. 

My take home money should be at least $3000. Which is about $4761.

But of course I wouldnâ€™t mind if my salary is $3000. :)
