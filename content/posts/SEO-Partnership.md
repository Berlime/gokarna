## New SEO Service

Today marks the journey of introducing a new suite of services to my agency. Before we dive in, let me tell you a story about why offering SEO services may not be as easy as spinning up a new product line. You see, running an agency has its own challenges, especially with limited resources in terms of manpower and financial capabilities. My agency's core product offers a web development service. This service alone involves thousands of technicalities that require a certain level of skillset.

I have been drafting the core features for SEO Services only to realize that I am not really proficient in this field. Sure, I know some terms and best practices, but to truly delve into it and provide quality services is beyond my capacity. It's not that I am not capable or unwilling to develop a new skill; rather, I choose to stay focused, efficient, and improve on my own forte.

This way, I can better provide planning and keep up with the ever-changing world of technology.

With that in mind, I believe that working as a team is crucial; in other words, getting someone to do it for me, or at least forming a partnership where both of us can work together and achieve results for clients.

## The SEO Service

Now, Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. not only designs and develops websites but also provides a value-added service in organic marketing. "...while Ads are good, SEO is important" is a phrase that opens up a wider perspective in terms of how much value it can offer to a website or business.

Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. will provide three different price tiers alongside Google's Pay-Per-Click (Ads Setup). The first tier will be sufficient for 90% of small-to-medium businesses, while the second provides much more data to achieve results faster. The third tier is the most premium, which includes a few blog posts per week. These services come with an upfront payment and then a recurring plan billed quarterly or annually (with a greater discount). This is the initial idea at least, and we may make some changes along the way.

It is recommended to have a full 12-month commitment to see results and gain authority. This proves to the internet algorithm that your website or business is valuable. So our service will require clients to commit for at least six months to see results or have sufficient data points on where they can improve. For some, six months is hefty because it also means clients have to pay upfront for six months.

Our last resort is to offer three months instead of six months in terms of payments.

## In Partnership

Thanks to [Cloud Captor](https://cloudcaptor.com/), our partner agency providing SEO services to my pool of clients and my agency offering web development services for their clients. I believe this way we can together bring a lot of value to many more people, helping young businesses thrive and possibly outshine the big players.

# Outsourcing Isn't Necessarily a Bad Thing

In this complicated field of industry, Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. has a set of criteria to be eligible to work with. These criteria look for industry-standard structure, skill level, past projects, and much more.

This is to ensure that Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. provides world-class results, outcomes, workflows, and more.

In the ideal world, Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. aims to help startups focus more on their core workflows and let Berlime Solutions Pte. Ltd. handle the front-end. This helps startups save their resources while effectively gaining traffic, credibility, and outreach.
