You see ever since my late mom got this house, it is still in the current vanilla state. My late mom did not opt for any renovations or even fancy decorations and pieces of furniture.

The only thing that my mom did is the kitchen cabinet and countertop which did not come included when we got this house. 

Oh yeah, we got it first-hand, brand new back in around 2014.

Now it is 2024. It is really due for a brand new paint. Gosh, can you imagine how long?!

So it is just a small bedroom, square, pretty decent height in ceiling. 

I thought choosing colours was easy but nope. I was totally wrong. Haha! Can you believe I spent hours and days looking for the ideal colours for my eyes, the environment and the look and feel I wanted? Turns out it can be quite daunting. LOL.

Well lucky there is a help of Pinterest which cuts of my decision-making by half! 

Well, we had fun painting the room, the best part is actually decluttering and trash things that are not needed. Oh yup, we remove everything in the room and leave nothing behind to make way for a very efficient painting work. Nope LOL. 

Gosh we are so noob at painting and our body is aching here and there. But the thing that I find this painting is the key moment in life is because that we actually land on the colours that will last probably another 10 years. >.<

And also, we do not colour all the walls, we only colour the ceiling, and 1 of the 4 walls. The rest is just white. According to my godly hours of research, there is a colour illusion that makes a square room look long.

Well I didnâ€™t notice it actually, but just getting the room freshly painted already makes it look way more beautiful than the outdated walls.
