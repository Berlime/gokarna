Hello there, here is the first backtracked post. It is a draft I created while developing this new Hugo site. Let me bring you back in time. The post date is the event date that happened. The real date that I post a backtracked blog will have a "Original Post Date:"

>Original Post date: 19th March 2024

Happy new year! It's 2024. How was 2023? I'm sure it was a blast. I want to share something exciting for this year.

You see, I run a small web-design agency, a super small one. I started my "Pte. Ltd" (similar to LLCin the U.S) back in September 2023. The reason is, it is time for my hard-work to be available for everyone.

But wouldn't it be just fine to offer services as a side hustle without the hassle of a "Pte. Ltd."? You say... Well, you see there are datas that are worth taking note, according to Small Business Trends quoted from [Embroker](https://www.embroker.com/blog/startup-statistics/#:~:text=The%20number%20one%20reason%20why,found%20in%2042%25%20of%20cases.&text=The%20second%20largest%20reason%20why,of%20funding%20and%20personal%20money.&text=Other%20notable%20cases%20of%20failure,beat%20by%20competition%20(19%25).), 2 out of 5 startups are profitable...

These type of start-up recieve excessive amount of fundings from investor's and venture capitalists.

So, being an intangible service provider and nowhere near to have access for large fundings, I am sure that I need to form some sort of a workflow for me, my team and my clients. I believe the first 3 years is so called the RnD stage before my company can put me on payroll and eventually my team.

With that in mind, WordPress (The platform I use widely) is finally having an official meet up 30 minutes from my neighbourhood! For context, it is hard for someone to conduct an official WordPress meet up, their rules, regulations & requirements is very strict. In fact in my country where I live, there is only 3 states that have an official WordPress community and one of them being around me!

Well, this solves the lonely journey I faced working infront of my computer interacting with screens, keyboard and mouse. Im grateful that I made new friends which are likely minded people that uses WordPress.

The approach of getting my "Pte. Ltd." seems to have a good first impression that I do things professionally and credible. So if you are still thinking of not incorporating your business, let me just break it to you, it is worth every penny.

You will learn about the legal matters, taxes and how your country works in terms of running a business. This way, your next big step can be easily achieved. Best part is, you do not have to do it everything by yourself! In fact, my company uses [Osome](https://my.osome.com/get-started?q=sg-referral&clientref=8M3K8G) to handle most of the part and it includes accounting!
