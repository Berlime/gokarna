## Sour Dough

My wife recently is interested to make her own sourdough, thanks to B.E.N (You can refer to the post I talk about B.E.N, a grocery store. Click [Here](https://alterego.berlime.com/posts/ben/)) Sourdough have a lot of variety, types, shape, taste & purpose.

I recommend Goat Cheese Sandwhich to go with. It is a classic sandwhich that consists of a slice of sour dough, a thick slice of goat cheese, drizzle with olive oil and season it with some salt and black pepper. Toast it for about 5 minutes, and for the extra touch, blow torch the top surface to have some smoked/charred taste. Or if you somehow have a [salamander](https://www.webstaurantstore.com/guide/969/what-is-a-salamander-oven.html), a cooking equipment.

You can try this out, you can thank me later. It's no where found in cafes or restaurant since it is a very niche dish that not many people knew about.

### After Having Store Bought Sourdough,

My Wife decides to make her own sourdough, thanks to socal media's reel and shorts. She gave it a go with a lot trials and errors to the point that she makes her own yeast. Which what they usually call a starter. This is actually new to me, coming from an ex-pattisiere.

It is a yeast substitute but not quite function as a dry yeast. After having many tries. I got intruiged. See I was in a baking school right after my O Levels or high school for states readers. Being intruiged, because of her trying out sourdoughs multiple time, why not I join her and make a whiteload instead, which I made before back when I was working at a pastry kitchen.

It triggers me instantly and started baking right away, I drop all my pending client's request and stuff and just give it a go. I got excited, I can't remember when the last time a bake a bread. Decades. Trust me.

I pull off my large pink ring-file with all the recipes I have R&D'ed before and get right into it.

### Oh Boy, It Turns Out Amazing

Imagine; you have an option to bake your own whitebread which I believe everyhouse hold buy off from the convenience store.
No doubt it is much more fresh, healthier (in terms of presevations), cheaper and most importantly, fun!

The only chance you got to try a freshly baked white loaf, fresh from the oven, crispy skin and soft inside; is to make your own!

Let me know if you want the recipe; Id probably make a short video of it!
