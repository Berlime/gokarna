## Hugo is a static site generator.

Introduced by my good friend of mind back in Secondary school. I straight away fell in love in static sites. I have been dabbling into WordPress thinking that it is the Holy Grail of web development. *buzzz!!* nope. I was totally wrong.

Tasnim, actually first started using Hugo for his own personal blog. He thought me a lot about how VSCODE works, he is darn good at explaining complex things into simple terms. Which struck me like a lightning.

It is also easy to get start with well documented tutorials. And exciting themes to choose from. And here I landed with a theme called Gokarna.

*Shout out to [Avijit Gupta](https://buymeacoffee.com/avijitgupta) for such a great work and the other author and [contributors](https://github.com/gokarna-theme/gokarna-hugo)!

The footer of this blog, and the image remains as to credit the huge amount of work for those who create this theme which is perfect and simple at least according to my design needs.
