I live in Johor Bahru, Malaysia. Specifically, Western part of Johor. Near Legoland Malaysia.
In my area, there isn't much groceries store around, there about 6 supermarkets nearby (at least 10 - 30mins). Further than that, I do not consider it nearby.

6 supermarkets may sound a lot for some. But not to me because most of them sell the same things. Say for an example, I could not find any natural sea salt in most of the super market.

Not that I do not appreciate them, but nowadays I am starting to be health cautious when it comes to food.
So I feel like, changing to a healthier diet is worth the investments. It is like the cheapest life-insurance anyone could get.

Not only sea salt, but also some other stuffs like high-quality pastas, some organic vegetables.

Fortunately, there is this store called Ben's Independant Grocer or [BIG Grocer](https://big.com.my/) grocer, whichever they want to call it.
I find that it is really not that expensive if we were to switch to better, healthier and much more quality food products for me & my wife to cook at home. 

I am not going into the details of how much it costs overall but I can safely say that the bill increase is probably about 5% to 10% from regular supermarkets (or normal products)

How I see this expense is just that small increase is a great "life-insurance" deal that I can get. Also, going to the healither route is never too late so I decide to make the switch.

Eventually, I will slowly switch to a much healthier food produces which I think everyone should do.

***Actually, I am sharing this because this supermarket open up a whole lot of new options I can include in our meals and I was very excited about it and wanted to share this. Hehe.***
