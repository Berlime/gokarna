## First Berlime's Funnel (TOFU *a.k.a Top Of the Funnel*)

You can read more about Tofu [here](https://link.com). A funnel is basically a terminology used to generate leads. It is basically a way to filter through visitors or people that captures their attention into your business. A way of getting leads is to filter out the people through a funnel.

So, Tofu is exactly how it sounds like. We first bring people into the funnel which is the widest part of the funnel. So that first, wide layer is called 'top of the funnel". Which essentially what people see when they first enter your funnel.

### Creating a funnel is not as easy as I thought.

At first, I outlined in a simple list format, to the things I wanted to share when people enter my funnel. Then when I started to dive into it further, turning it into a diagram format which also telling me the visuals of what are the steps taken when they enter the funnel. Turns out, I overlooked tonnes of stages.

My goal is to send them a few e-mails and a free e-guide (PDF). Setting it up took me and my team almost 2 quarters to complete as we are complete beginners and never ever done this in our entire journey of web development. 

This process realises that there are a lot more things to work on to run my agency.

### Now that I know, I took it slowly and took a practical approach.

I use to plan a lot of things in a quarter, like 10 projects to complete. But the process of creating a simple Funnel made me realise our capacity. My capacity, and my team's capacity. Turns out, we do not have the luxury of time and knowledge to execute new things.

This event, leads us to eventually take it slowly, one at a time and decide to work on only 3 projects for each quarter. On top of the "must-do" work like administritative tasks, meetings, cold calls, maintenance and other necessary taks.

### Our Funnel done.

Can you imagine that this project was supposed to be completed in the first quarter of this year, but we only completed it in the 3rd quarter. It was a mess and a lesson learn the hard way.

All I want to say today is, sometimes we need to takes things slowly and do not rush to complete things. This is afterall an internal thing, I mean, it does not involve any clients or urgent matters that could lose a fortune. With that, we are much more capable now of analysing which projects to execute first and which ones that could bring us more traction. Versus just creating it and chase a deadline that no one asks for.

### Conclusion: Just Take Your Time.
