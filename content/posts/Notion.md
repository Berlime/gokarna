## Notion.so - The Superpower I Stumble Upon

Notion is an app that you can decide on how do you want it to be. It is generally a note taking app. On steroids, if you want it.
You can choose to make it as simple as a regular note taking app, or you can also turn it into a *"super app"* like how I did, to run my agency.

I also run an internal finance insights for my agency. You see, having an accountant running a business is a must have. Even when you subscribe a software to comply with the regulations. You still have some sort of limitation in manipulating your finance like setting aside budgets, create internal accounts for a certain category of stuffs. Well, Notion allows me to do that.

You can simply click the tags above to find out more about my Agency.

### An app that help me consolidate things, better.

You see, previously, I use multiple apps to keep track of my personal stuffs, house inventory, my own personal finance, vehicle service records, purchased high ticket house equipments, etc You name it. I got everything, literally recorded.

As you probably expected, the software I used is the good ol' Microsof Excel.

If you think that is a lot, I still also have my agency to run. Long story short, I use hundreds of apps to mangage my life, both personal and business.

For people like me, cross-device syncing is also very important to me, I use all ecosystems, Windows, Apple, Android, iOS, Tablet(s) and even Linux.

It helped my really organise my stuffs and I got a lot more productive and get things done faster, believe me.

For starters, I use Notion for my CRM, Customised Finance Management, Sofware licensings. All dynamically created with analytics and report if I need. (Thanks to help of templates in the Notion marketplace)

If you are in the market of note taking app, there is first, of course, [Notion.so](https://notion.so) and also worth mentioning [Capacities.io](https://capacities.io) which I got introduced by a good friend of mine.
