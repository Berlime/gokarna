## A different approach

I have been using Elementor builder for a WordPress project. No doubt it is a great tool for me to start or in fact, anyone! This is the builder that I used when I first discovered WordPress. (The right way LOL) - *will definitely blog about this.*

I quickly discovered that there are bunch of options you can include the tech-stack for your WordPress journey. Thanks to the nature of a technology, which tends to change/updates really fast. The theme that I used realesed a native 'Full-Site Editing' experience.

Which also introduced at the same time of the realease by WordPress. It is called Spectra.

Without fancy features, pretty much straight forward, clean overall look. I decide to give it a try for a good friend of mine that runs his own traditional music ensemble. 

You can have a look [here](https://nurusysyabab.com). 

### The challenging part

If you visited the site, I tried creating the hero section where a few elements overlaps each other. I took quite sometime for me to achieve the best look for all types of screen sizes. This is actually the first so called hero section with overlaping images, interfaces, elements and some texts.

This is the part that I realise I am really bad at designing elements. xD
