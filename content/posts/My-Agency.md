Hello there, here is the first post that I will be sharing about my agency.

I run a web design and development agenncy. I started out small by creating a website for my wedding business. This was before the Covid-19 pandemic.
My sole purpose to create a website for my wedding business is to seamlessly connect multiple providers with customers without having to communicate with me the wedding planner.

It is a system a develop and still in developing for available for public as [an app](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-saas). More on that some other time, keep a look out at my "agency" tagged blog post for updates.

The moment I successfully launch my wedding business's website. The whole world is on lockdown. Hence, there are zero wedding activities. All customers refunded and there was no business. I was stuck, clueless and depressed on how I am going to sustain.

Long story short, I decide to offer creating website for my friends and families and little did I know it had snowballed into something significant.

So that was a brief introduction how my agency started. Today I am going to talk about more on the progress on my web agency.

My agency's website [berlime.com](https://berlime.com) runs on WordPress with Elementor builder. See, without prior experience the way I develop is whole lot of mess. It lacks standardisation, maintinibilty and no design system.
This week, I finally dive deeper to revamp the website.

This time, with proper planning, hierarchy, framework, design system and whole lot of other structures including the serverside.

This also revamps the pricing range and how our agency can provide seamless maintenance with less headaches on client sides especially in terms of understanding ang changing the technical aspects by themselves.
This week marks and oboarding of the new website and also the whole system. The codename for this project is Berlime 2.0. Which is much more business driven rather than freelancing, previously.

Keep a look out on my next "agency" tagged post to follow my journey in my small agency in hopes that you have some takeaways and ideas that could be implemented in whatever you do.

Till next time!
